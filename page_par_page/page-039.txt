DEBUG IT!
HELP! CAN YOU DEBUG THESE FIVE
SCRATCH PROGRAMS?
In this activity, you will investigate what is
going awry and find a solution for each of
the five Debug It! challenges.

! DEBUG IT! 1.1 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10437040
When the green flag is clicked, both Gobo and Scratch Cat should
start dancing. But only Scratch Cat starts Dancing! How do we fix the
program?

! DEBUG IT! 1.2 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10437249
In this project, when the green flag is clicked, the Scratch Cat should
start on the left side of the stage, say something about being on the
left side, glide to the right side of the stage, and say something
about being on the right side. It works the first time the green flag is
clicked, but not again. How do we fix the program?

! DEBUG IT! 1.3 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10437366

START HERE
! Go to the Unit 1 Debug It! studio:
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475483

The Scratch Cat should do a flip when the space key is pressed. But
when the space key is pressed, nothing happens! How do we fix the
program?

! Test and debug each of the five debugging
challenges in the studio.
! Write down your solution or remix the buggy
program with your solution.

! DEBUG IT! 1.4 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10437439
In this project, the Scratch Cat should pace back and forth across the
stage, when it is clicked. But the Scratch Cat is flipping out – and is
walking upside down! How do we fix the program?

! DEBUG IT! 1.5 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10437476

THINGS…

! Make a list of possible bugs in the program.
! Keep track of your work! This can be a useful reminder of
what you have already tried and point you toward what to
try next.
! Share and compare your problem finding and problem
solving approaches with a neighbor until you find
something that works for you!

In this project, when the green flag is clicked, the Scratch Cat should
saw ‘Meow, meow, meow!’ in a speech bubble and as a sound. But
the speech bubble happens before the sound – and the Scratch Cat
only makes one ‘Meow’ sound! How do we fix the program?

FINISHED?
+  Discuss your testing and debugging practices with a partner.
Make note of the similarities and differences in your strategies.
+  Add code commentary by right clicking on blocks in your scripts.
This can help others understand different parts of your program!
+  Help a neighbor!
