30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Let students experience what it’s like to be in your teaching
shoes! Challenge students to create, remix, or reimagine an
activity or resource designed to support others' explorations
of creative computing. Optionally, have the Activity Design
handout available for additional support.
! Help students brainstorm and imagine different kinds of
creative learning experiences. Optionally, review example
project ideas and activities from this guide, or encourage
students to explore the Scratch Cards resource and Scratch
Design Studio list for inspiration. Then, give students time
to design their own learning activity or resource.
! Give students opportunities to test out their activity or
resource with learners. Encourage them to share their
activity or resource with family or friends, or invite students
to be peer mentors for other classes, clubs, or events.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  Students particularly interested in supporting others’
learning can be great candidates for becoming peer
mentors during class or at an afterschool or lunchtime
Scratch Club.

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  Who do you envision using your activity or resource?
+  What do you hope people will learn from using your
activity or resource?
+  What challenges might learners experience in doing the
activity or using the resource? How might you further
support them in dealing with these challenges?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Does the activity or resource facilitate an introduction or
exploration into creative computing? What feedback can
you offer the student?
