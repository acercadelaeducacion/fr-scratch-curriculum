final project showcase
T I M E

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Remind students that they will be sharing their projects with
each other (and possibly guests) as a way of acknowledging
the hard work that has taken place and of reflecting on
their experiences. Explain that this session is an opportunity
for finalizing their works-in-progress and coming up with a
strategy for sharing their projects with others.
! Give students time to work on their projects and prepare for
presenting final drafts at the project showcase. Optionally,
collect final works-in-progress into a class studio for ease in
presenting. Optionally, invite students to add their projects
to the Hackathon studio.
! Distribute the Project Reflections handout to students and
discuss the What?, So what?, Now what? framework as a way
for them to present their experiences to others.

NOTES
+  Students may be feeling anxious or stressed about
completing their projects. This is an opportunity to remind
them that: (1) this experience is just a waypoint on their
paths as computational creators, and (2) some types of
stress can be good, helping us to focus on our goals and get
things done!
