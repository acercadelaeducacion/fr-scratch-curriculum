CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
This unit focuses on helping students develop their storytelling
and remixing abilities through a variety of hands-on and offcomputer design activities, providing opportunities for students
to work collaboratively and build on the creative work of others.
Building on initial experiences from Unit 2, the activities in this
unit are designed to help students develop deeper fluency in the
computational concepts of events and parallelism and the
computational practices of experimenting and iterating and
reusing and remixing. Each capacity-building activity is
designed to help students build up storytelling projects by
discovering new blocks and methods for programming
interactions between sprites and backdrops, culminating in a
Pass It On project.
