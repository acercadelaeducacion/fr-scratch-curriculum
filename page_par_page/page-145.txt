COMPUTATIONAL THINKING
Over the past several years, we have been captivated by “computational thinking” as a way to describe the learning and development that
take place with Scratch. In this section, we share: (1) our definition of computational thinking as a set of concepts, practices, and
perspectives, (2) an instrument for assessing student proficiency with computational practices, and (3) a self-reflection instrument to help
teachers assess how they support computational practices in the classroom.
These definitions and instruments were developed in collaboration with Wendy Martin, Francisco Cervantes, and Bill Tally from Education
Development Center’s Center for Children & Technology, and Mitch Resnick from MIT Media Lab. Additional computational thinking
resources are available at http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/ct

COMPUTATIONAL CONCEPTS
CONCEPT

DESCRIPTION

sequence

identifying a series of steps for a task

loops

running the same sequence multiple times

parallelism

making things happen at the same time

events

one thing causing another thing to happen

conditionals

making decisions based on conditions

operators

support for mathematical and logical expressions

data

storing, retrieving, and updating values

COMPUTATIONAL PRACTICES
PRACTICE

DESCRIPTION

experimenting and iterating

developing a little bit, then trying it out, then developing some more

testing and debugging

making sure things work – and finding and solving problems when they arise

reusing and remixing

making something by building on existing projects or ideas

abstracting and modularizing

exploring connections between the whole and the parts

COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVES
PERSPECTIVE

DESCRIPTION

expressing

realizing that computation is a medium of creation
“I can create.”

connecting

recognizing the power of creating with and for others
“I can do different things when I have access to others.”

questioning

feeling empowered to ask questions about the world
“I can (use computation to) ask questions to make sense of (computational things in) the world.”
