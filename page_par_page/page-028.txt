UNIT 1
OVERVIEW
THE “BIG IDEA”
Many of the educators that we have worked with over the
years wrestle with two questions when getting started with
creative computing: “What’s the best way of helping learners
get started?” and “What do I, as teacher, need to know?”
The writings of Seymour Papert (a renowned mathematician,
educator, and major influence on the development of Scratch
through the Logo programming language) serve as
inspiration for thinking about these questions.
With respect to the first question, two extreme positions tend
to be taken up. Either learners need to be told what to do
and should have highly structured experiences – or learners
need to be left totally alone to explore under their own
direction. Papert, a proponent of the notion that young
learners should act as advocates for and explorers of their
own thinking and learning, encouraged teachers to seek a
balance between teaching and learning. Throughout the
guide, we vary the amount of structure in the activities in an
effort to provide balance.
With respect to the second question, educators sometimes
worry that they don’t “know” enough about Scratch to be
able to help others. We encourage you to take a broad view
of what it means to “know” Scratch. You don’t need to know
everything about the Scratch interface or how to solve every
problem that a learner encounters. But, as Papert noted,
educators can serve as cognitive guides, asking questions
and helping break down problems into manageable pieces.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

NOTES

Students will:
+  build on initial explorations of the Scratch environment by
creating an interactive Scratch project
+  be introduced to a wider range of Scratch blocks
+  become familiar with the concept of sequence
+  practice experimenting and iterating while creating projects

+  Make sure students already have a Scratch account for saving and
sharing their projects online.
+  Think about how you plan to access your students’ work. For
example, you can create class studios to collect projects, have
students email you project links, or start a class blog.
