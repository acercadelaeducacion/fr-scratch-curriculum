DEBUG IT!

! DEBUG IT! 3.1 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24269007
In this project, the Scratch Cat teaches Gobo to meow. But when it's
Gobo's turn to try -- Gobo stays silent. How do we fix the program?

HELP! CAN YOU DEBUG THESE FIVE
SCRATCH PROGRAMS?
! DEBUG IT! 3.2 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24269046
In this activity, you will investigate what is
going awry and find a solution for each of
the five Debug It! challenges.

In this project, the Scratch Cat is supposed to count from 1 to the
number the user provides. But the Scratch Cat always counts to 10.
How do we fix the program?

! DEBUG IT! 3.3 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24269070
In this project, the Scratch Cat is doing roll call with Gobo's friends:
Giga, Nano, Pico, and Tera. But everything is happening all at once!
How do we fix the program?

START HERE
! Go to the Unit 3 Debug It! Studio:
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475554
! Test and debug each of the five debugging
challenges in the studio.
! Write down your solution or remix the buggy
program with your solution.

! DEBUG IT! 3.4 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24269097
In this project, the Scratch Cat and Gobo are practicing their jumping
routine. When Scratch Cat says "Jump!", Gobo should jump up and
down. But Gobo isn't jumping. How do we fix the program?

THINGS…

! Make a list of possible bugs in the program.
! Keep track of your work! This can be a useful reminder of
what you have already tried and point you toward what to
try next.
! Share and compare your problem finding and problem
solving approaches with a neighbor until you find
something that works for you!

In this project, the scene changes when you press the right arrow
key. The star of the project -- a dinosaur -- should be hidden in every
scene except when the scene transitions to the auditorium backdrop.
In the auditorium, the dinosaur should appear and do a dance. But
the dinosaur is always present and is not dancing at the right time.

FINISHED?
+  Add code commentary by right clicking on blocks in your scripts.
This can help others understand different parts of your program!
+  Discuss your testing and debugging practices with a partner, and
make note of the similarities and differences in your strategies.
+  Help a neighbor!
