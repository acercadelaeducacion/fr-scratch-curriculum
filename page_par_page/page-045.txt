CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
Programming in Scratch is like directing theatre. In theatre, just
as in Scratch, there are characters (sprites, in Scratch parlance),
costumes, backdrops, scripts, and a stage. Scratch programming
utilizes cues called “events”, which signal when things should
occur in a project, such as: activating a project (when green flag
clicked), triggering sprites’ actions (when this sprite clicked), or
even sending a silent cue across sprites or backdrops
(broadcast).
Inspired by the theatre metaphor, this unit’s arts-themed
activities are designed to help students explore the
computational concepts of loops, events, and parallelism,
culminating in the design of personalized music videos.
