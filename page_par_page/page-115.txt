WHAT IS A HACKATHON?
“Hack” has a negative connotation to some – but it has a long history of standing for playfulness, curiosity, persistence, and creativity.
One of our favorite definitions frames “hack” as “an appropriate application of ingenuity”. With this definition, what better capacity for
young learners than learning how to “hack”?
A hackathon takes the playful ingenuity of hacking – and situates it in an intensely focused and time-limited context. In this unit, learners
will brainstorm an idea, develop a project, and showcase a final prototype using an iterative plan-make-share cycle.

THE “BIG IDEA”

Hackathons provide excellent opportunities for learners to invent their own personally meaningful and relevant projects to work on, which
can be developed as independent final projects or in collaborative teams. It is a chance for students to demonstrate their knowledge in
Scratch, expand upon current skills, and develop and test ideas within a collaborative, creative, flexible, and playful learning environment.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
