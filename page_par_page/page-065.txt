CONVERSATIONS
WHAT ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO
COORDINATE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN
SPRITES?
In this activity, you'll explore different ways
to program sprites to have conversations!
Experiment with timing and explore using
broadcast by remixing a joke project.

START HERE
! Look inside the Penguin Jokes project:
http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10015800
! Investigate the code to see how the wait and say
blocks are used to coordinate the conversation.
! Remix the project to use the broadcast and when I
receive blocks instead of wait blocks.
