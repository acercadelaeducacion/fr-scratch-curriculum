SCENES
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
STAGE AND SPRITES?
In this activity, you will create a project that
experiments with backdrops, like a story with
multiple scenes or a slideshow.

START HERE
! Choose from the library, paint, or upload multiple
backdrops into your project.
! Experiment with blocks from the Looks and Events
categories to initiate switching backdrops.
! Add scripts to the stage and sprites to coordinate
what happens when the backdrop changes in your
project!

THINGS TO TRY
! Look for blocks under the sprites and the
stage related to backdrop and test them out
to see what they do!
! Need more inspiration? Explore the Scratch
online community to discover projects that
use multiple backdrops.

FINISHED?
+  Add your project to the Scenes Studio: http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475550
+  Challenge yourself to do more! Add more backdrop changes to your project.
+  Help a neighbor!
+  Return to one of your previous projects or find a project you are inspired by and
remix it by adding switching backdrops.
