30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, show example projects from the Orange Square,
Purple Circle studio and have the Orange Square, Purple
Circle handout available to guide students.
! Give students time to create a project that includes an
orange square and a purple circle. Invite students to
experiment with Looks blocks and the paint editor to
explore their artistic abilities.
! Encourage students to share their creative work with others.
We recommend gallery walk: have students put their
projects in presentation mode and then invite them to walk
around and explore each other’s projects. Optionally, have
students add their projects to the Orange Square, Purple
Circle studio or a class studio.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  If students have questions, remind them that they can open
the Tips Window to learn more about specific blocks or
different parts of the Scratch editor.
+  Scratch supports both bitmap and vector graphics. Help
students navigate to the vector mode or bitmap mode
button in the paint editor to design and manipulate
different types of images and text.
