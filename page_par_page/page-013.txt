CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
Ready to get started? This unit is designed for those who are
completely new to Scratch. From exploring inspiring projects, to
creating a Scratch account, to having an initial experience
playing with the Scratch project editor, each activity is designed
to guide you and your students through the process of getting
started with Scratch.
In each unit, we offer a selection of activities – but we
encourage you to tinker with the choice and order of the
activities. Different contexts and audiences will invite different
experiences. Choose your own adventure by mixing and
matching the activities in ways that are most compelling for you
and the learners you support.
