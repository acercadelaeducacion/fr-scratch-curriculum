UNIT 2 ACTIVITY

DEBUG IT!
S U G G E S T E D

15 – 3 0 M I N U T E S

OBJECTIVES

By completing this activity, students will:
+  investigate the problem and find a solution to five
debugging challenges
+  explore a range of concepts (including sequence and
loops) through the practices of testing and debugging
+  develop a list of strategies for debugging projects

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, have the Unit 2 Debug It! handout available to
guide students during the activity.
! Help students open the Debug It! programs from the Unit 2
Debug It! studio or by following the project links listed on
the Unit 2 Debug It! handout. Encourage students to click
on the “Look Inside” button to investigate the buggy
program, tinker with problematic code, and test possible
solutions.
! Give students time to test and debug each Debug It!
challenge. Optionally, have students use the remix function
in Scratch to fix the bugs and save corrected programs.
! Ask students to reflect back on their testing and debugging
experiences by responding to the reflection prompts in their
design journals or in a group discussion.
! Create a class list of debugging strategies by collecting
students’ problem finding and problem solving approaches.

NOTES
+  Facilitate this activity in a whole group by having students
act out the Debug It! programs in a similar way to the
Performing Scripts activity, or introduce performing scripts
as a new strategy for testing and debugging projects.

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  What was the problem?
+  How did you identify the problem?
+  How did you fix the problem?
+  Did others have alternative approaches to fixing the
problem?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Were students able to solve all five bugs? If not, how
might you clarify the concepts expressed in the unsolved
programs?
+  What different testing and debugging strategies did
students employ?
