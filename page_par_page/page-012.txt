UNIT 0
OVERVIEW
THE “BIG IDEA”
When we shared a draft of this guide with teachers,
a common initial reaction was, “Unit 0?!? Why 0?”
We hoped to communicate that this is a preparatory
unit, supporting you in establishing a culture of
creative computing through creating, personalizing,
sharing, and reflecting. Our ambition to support this
type of learning culture will be evident throughout
the guide.
Creative computing culture has an intellectual
dimension, engaging with a set of computational
concepts and practices. It has a physical dimension,
encouraging interactions with others through the
placement of desks, chairs, and computers. Most
importantly, it has an affective dimension,
cultivating a sense of confidence and fearlessness.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

KEY WORDS, CONCEPTS, & PRACTICES

Students will:
+  be introduced to the concept of computational creation, in the
context of Scratch
+  be able to imagine possibilities for their own Scratch-based
computational creation
+  become familiar with resources that support their computational
creation
+  prepare for creating Scratch projects by establishing Scratch
accounts, exploring Scratch studios, creating design journals, and
organizing critique groups

+  profile editor
+  project page
+  studio

+  critique croup
+  red, yellow, green

NOTES
+  Coordinate with your IT department to make sure your
computers can access the Scratch website.
+  Don’t have internet access? An offline version of Scratch is
available for download:
