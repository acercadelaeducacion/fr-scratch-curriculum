sound: An audio file that can be played in a Scratch project, available by importing from Scratch's built-in sound library, or creating a
new recording. Sounds are played by using sound blocks, which control a sound's volume, tempo, and more.
sprite: A media object that performs actions on the stage in a Scratch project.
stage: The background of a Scratch project. The stage can have scripts, backdrops (costumes), and sounds, similar to a sprite.
studio: A user-created gallery in the Scratch online community that can be used to highlight projects contributed by one or many users.
testing and debugging: The computational practice of making sure things work – and finding and solving problems when they
arise.
theatre metaphor: A way of describing the design of Scratch that emphasizes its intentional similarity to theatre, with actors
(sprites), costumes, backdrops, scripts, and a stage.
tips window: Built directly into the Project Editor, the Tips Window is a form of getting help in Scratch.
unfocus group: An activity in which students share their projects-in-progress and request feedback from a diverse collection of
people.
variables and lists: A changeable value or collection of values recorded in Scratch’s memory. Variables can store one value at a
time, while lists can store multiple values.
vector graphic: An image that is defined by a collection of geometric shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles) and colors. Contrast with
bitmap.
video sensing: A Scratch feature that makes use of video from a webcam to detect motion or display video input on the stage.
