EXTENSIONS
HOW CAN YOU EXTEND AND REIMAGINE
GAMES IN SCRATCH?
Get into game design by adding extended
features within your Scratch project! Choose
at least one (or more!) of the following
extensions and add it to your previously
started maze, pong, or scrolling games.

+ SCORE http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1940443

Demonstrates how to set and change a score. Receive 10 points every
time the Scratch cat is clicked.

+ LEVELS http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1940453

Demonstrates how to change levels. Score increases by 1 every time the
space bar is pressed. Level increases by 1 for every 10 points.

+ TIMER http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1940445

Demonstrates how to use a timer. Use the mouse to navigate the Scratch
cat to Gobo.

+ ENEMIES http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1940450

Demonstrates how to add an enemy. Avoid the tennis ball by using the
up and down arrow keys.

+ REWARDS http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1940456

START HERE

Demonstrates how to collect items. Use the arrow keys to move the
Scratch cat around to collect quest items.

! Go to the Extensions studio:
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475619
! Choose one (or more) of the extensions to explore.
! Incorporate your choice into your previously started
game projects!

+ MOUSE http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/25192659

Demonstrates how to program the mouse to control game play. Move the
mouse to move the paddle.

+ RESTART http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/25192935

Demonstrates how to make a button to restart the game. Click on the
RESTART button to restart.

+ MENU http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/25192991

Demonstrates how to display a menu screen at the beginning of the
game. Click START or DIRECTIONS on the menu screen.

+ MULTIPLAYER http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/25192711

Demonstrates how to add another player to the game. Player 1 uses the
arrow keys to navigate Pico through the maze, and player 2 uses the
W, A, S, D keys to navigate Nano through the maze.

THINGS TO TRY
+  The backpack can be an extremely useful tool while
programming in Scratch. It can store everything from lines of
code, to music files, to sprites, and more. Try using it to
incorporate extensions into your game projects.
+  Alternatively, sketching out ideas and bits of code in your design
journal is another great method for planning how to incorporate
your extensions.

FINISHED?
+  Add another extension to your maze, pong, or scrolling game.
+  Challenge yourself to do more! Continue going through each of
the extensions and add them to your games.
+  Help a neighbor!
+  Share your project with a neighbor and give each other feedback
on your games.
