MAZE
HOW CAN YOU USE SCRATCH TO BUILD
AN INTERACTIVE GAME?
In this project, you will create a game. This
game includes interactions between sprites,
score, and levels. You move a sprite from the
start of a maze to the end without touching
the walls.

START HERE
! Draw a maze-like background and use different
colors for the walls and end-of-maze marker.
! Add a sprite.
! Make your game interactive!
These scripts give the player control over sprite movement in the maze.	  

THINGS TO TRY
! Add multiple levels to your game! This can be
done through the use of different backdrops and
using braodcast blocks to trigger the next level.
! Use the make a variable block to keep score!
! Experiment with timer blocks to add new
challenges to your maze!

This tells your sprite where to begin
and marks the start of the maze.	  

This will cause your sprite to bounce
off the blue walls of the maze.	  

BLOCKS TO PLAY WITH

This tells the end-of-maze sprite that
players win when the ball touches
this sprite.
