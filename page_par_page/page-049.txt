BUILD-A-BAND
HOW CAN YOU UTILIZE SCRATCH TO
CREATE SOUNDS, INSTRUMENTS, BANDS,
OR STYLES OF MUSIC THAT REPRESENT
THE MUSIC YOU LOVE MOST?
In this activity, you will build your own
music-inspired Scratch project by pairing
sprites with sounds to design interactive
instruments.

START HERE
! Create a sprite.
! Add sound blocks.
! Experiment with ways to make your instruments
interactive.

Choose instruments from the sprite library or create your own.	  

THINGS TO TRY
! Use repeat blocks to make a sound play more than once.
! Import or record your own sounds or experiment with the Sounds
editor.
! Try playing with the tempo blocks to speed up or slow down the
rhythm.

FINISHED?

instrument or record your own sounds.
