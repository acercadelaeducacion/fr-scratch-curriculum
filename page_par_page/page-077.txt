CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
In this unit, learners will become game designers and
experience creating their own game project. Guided by the
activities in this unit, students will be introduced to game
mechanics and game development while building
understandings of computational concepts (conditionals,
operators, data) and computational practices (abstracting and
modularizing).
You could get students started on their game projects with the
Starter Games activity and then support further development
through other activities. From learning common game
mechanics such as keeping score and side-scrolling, to the
creation of multiplayer games (e.g., Pong), Unit 4 activities
offer students multiple opportunities to practice game
development.
