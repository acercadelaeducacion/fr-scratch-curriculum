S U G G E S T E D

OBJECTIVES

By completing this activity, students will:
+  identify common design elements of games

T I M E

15 – 3 0 M I N U T E S

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Divide students into small groups of 2-3 people.
! In their small groups, ask students to generate a list of games
that they enjoy playing. They can compose the list using their
design journals or a sheet of paper. We suggest facilitating
the brain dump brainstorming activity: give students a short
time period (1-2 minutes) to write down as many games as
they can. Then, have students narrow down their favorites
from the brain dump list.
! After a few minutes, ask groups about their list of games:
What do the games have in common?
What features of their design make them a game?
! Facilitate a class discussion about what characteristics make
up a game and generate a class list of common game
mechanics. Next, ask students to imagine their dream game
and write a list of design elements for that game.
! Invite students to share their dream game lists in their
small groups or critique groups (see Unit 0 Critique Group
activity) to get feedback and suggestions.

NOTES
+  Invite students to refer back to this dream game list while
programming games in other Unit 4 activities.

RESOURCES
! paper to write down game design elements (optional)
! things to sketch with (pencils, pens, markers, etc.)
