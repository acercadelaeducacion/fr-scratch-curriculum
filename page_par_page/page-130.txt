GROUP
S U G G E S T E D

OBJECTIVES

By completing this activity, students will:
+  interview, observe, and ask others for feedback on
projects-in-progress
T I M E

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Hosting an unfocus group is an idea we borrow from IDEO.
Introduce the unfocus group concept, where students will share
their projects-in-progress and request feedback from a diverse
collection of people.
! Optionally, distribute the Unfocus Group handout to each
person.
! Help students brainstorm possible unfocus group participants.
Encourage them to consider their target audience as well as
unusual users or unexpected cases who can offer a unique
perspective or interesting feedback (e.g., parents, teachers,
siblings, other students, community members).
! Give students time to identify, interview, observe, and
record feedback from two unfocus group members.

RESOURCES
! Unfocus Group handout

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  Describe your unfocus group participants and why you
chose them.
+  How might their ideas influence your project?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Did students identify and interview two unfocus group
participants?

! Allow students time to meet with their project team members
to share feedback collected from different unfocus group
sources. Optionally, collect the completed Unfocus Group
handouts at the end of this activity to return to students at
the beginning of the Project Check-In or Design Sprint
sessions.

NOTES
+  Help students get creative in researching and discovering
feedback sources. Is there a local game design company
that might be interested in helping? Could projects be
shared with students from another school?
+  If unfocus group members are not available to be
interviewed during the session (e.g., teachers, parents,
siblings, community members), you can organize this
activity for outside of class time or assign it as homework.
