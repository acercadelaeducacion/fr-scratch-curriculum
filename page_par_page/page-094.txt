UNIT 5
OVERVIEW
THE
THE“BIG
“BIGIDEA”
IDEA”
After the release of the previous version of the guide, a
common piece of feedback that we received from teachers
was that they (and the learners they support) wanted more
“catch-up” time, time to linger, revisit, and extend the
ideas and projects they had created in previous units. In
response, we added this “Diving Deeper” unit.
Whether pushing ahead with advanced concepts and
practices or revisiting previous experiences, this is an
opportunity for learners to engage in a moment of
contemplation and reflection. What isn’t as clear as it could
be? What do they still want to know about Scratch? How
might others help them – and how might they help others?
This is also an opportunity for you, as educator, to engage
in similar acts of contemplation and reflection. What has
surprised you? What has made you uncomfortable? What
would you want to do differently next time? Why?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

KEY WORDS, CONCEPTS, & PRACTICES

Learners will:
+  reflect on past experiences to self-assess current learning goals
and needs
+  create a self-remix by extending a previously started project
+  be introduced to various hardware extensions that connect
Scratch to the physical world
+  gain more fluency in computational concepts and practices by
exploring the newest Scratch features (video sensing, cloning)
+  experiment with designing learning experiences for others

+  video sensing
+  cloning

+  peer interviews +  extensions
+  hardware
