SUPPORTING COMPUTATIONAL PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM
The following instrument can be used to help you reflect on how you are supporting computational practices in your
learning environment – which may be a classroom, a library, or another learning environment. The purpose of the
instrument is to help you notice the types of opportunities to learn that you are designing and supporting.

EXPERIMENTING AND ITERATING: developing a little bit, then trying it out, then developing some more
The activity provided opportunities for students to…

NONE

SOME

LOTS

build a project step by step
try things out as you go
make revisions based on what happens
try different ways to do things, or try new things
NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:
If none, how can I make room, or build time, for more?
If some, how can I deepen, or strengthen, those activities?
If lots, what have I noticed, or learned?

TESTING AND DEBUGGING: making sure things work – and finding and solving problems when they arise
The activity provided opportunities for students to…

NONE

SOME

LOTS

observe what happens when you run your project
describe what is different from what you want
read through the scripts to investigate the cause of the problem
make changes and test to see what happens
consider other ways to solve the problem
NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:
If none, how can I make room, or build time, for more?
If some, how can I deepen, or strengthen, those activities?
