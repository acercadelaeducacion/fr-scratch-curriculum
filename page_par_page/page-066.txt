UNIT 3 ACTIVITY

SCENES
S U G G E S T E D

OBJECTIVES

T I M E

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, show example projects from the Scenes studio and
have the Scenes handout available to guide students.
! Give students time to develop a project that includes
multiple scene changes using different backdrops, such as
in a slideshow. Challenge students to explore and
manipulate scripts in the Stage to initiate backdrop
changes.
! Allow students to share their projects with one another. We
suggest the design demo activity: invite a few students to
present their work to the class and demonstrate how they
implemented switching backdrops. Optionally, have students
add their projects to the Scenes studio or a class studio.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  If students are having trouble figuring out how to switch
backdrops, encourage them to tinker with blocks under the
Looks category, especially the switch backdrop to, switch
backdrop to and wait, and next backdrop blocks.

By completing this activity, students will:
+  be able to create a project that experiments with
changing backdrops, like a story with multiple scenes
or a slideshow
+  gain more familiarity with the computational concepts
of events and parallelism and the practice of
experimenting and iterating

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  What does the Stage have in common with sprites?
+  How is the Stage different from sprites?
+  How do you initiate a sprite’s actions in a scene?
+  What other types of projects (beyond animations) use
scene changes?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Do projects successfully coordinate multiple scenes using
changing backdrops?
