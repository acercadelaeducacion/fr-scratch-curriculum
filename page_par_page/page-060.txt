UNIT 3
OVERVIEW
THE
THE“BIG
“BIGIDEA”
IDEA”
In the introduction to his doctoral dissertation exploring
remix culture, Andres Monroy-Hernandez (the lead
designer of the initial version of the Scratch online
community) included three quotes:
Building on other people’s work has been a
longstanding practice in programming, and has only
been amplified by network technologies that provide
access to a wide range of other people’s work. An
important goal of creative computing is to support
connections between learners through reusing and
remixing. The Scratch authoring environment and online
community can support young designers in this key
computational practice by helping them find ideas and
code to build upon, enabling them to create more
complex projects than they could have created on their
own.
The activities in this unit offer initial ideas and strategies
for cultivating a culture that supports reusing and
remixing. How can you further support sharing and
connecting?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

KEY WORDS, CONCEPTS, & PRACTICES

Students will:
+  gain familiarity in and build understandings of the benefits of
reusing and remixing while designing
+  develop greater fluency with computational concepts (events and
parallelism) and practices (experimenting and iterating, testing
and debugging, reusing and remixing)
+  explore computational creation within the genre of stories by
designing collaborative narratives

+  reusing and
remixing
+  make a block

+  backpack
+  stage
+  pass-it-on story

+  pair programming
+  scratch screening
+  design demo

NOTES
+  Reusing and remixing support the development of critical
code-reading capacities and provoke important questions
about ownership and authorship. Consider different strategies
for how you might facilitate, discuss, and assess cooperative
and collaborative work.
