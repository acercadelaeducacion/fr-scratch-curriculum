UNIT 4 ACTIVITY

EXTENSIONS
S U G G E S T E D

By completing this activity, students will:
+  become more familiar with the concepts of
conditionals, operators, and data by exploring
programs that illustrate common game mechanics

T I M E

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, show example projects from the Extensions
studio and have the Extensions handout available to guide
students.
! Give students time to explore the code of programs in the
Extensions studio to investigate different ways games can be
increased in difficulty or extended. Ask students to select one
or more extensions to add to their previously started maze,
pong, or scrolling game projects. Give students time to
experiment and incorporate the extension(s) into their
games.
! Allow students to share their extended game projects with
one another. We suggest facilitating the pair-share or
design demo activity to let students share their games and
demonstrate what they learned.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  To provide more scaffolding for students needing extra
support, we suggest walking through one extension sample
program (e.g., levels) as a class and helping students add
the extension to their game projects.
+  The backpack tool is one way students can incorporate parts
of the extension projects into their starter games. Learn
