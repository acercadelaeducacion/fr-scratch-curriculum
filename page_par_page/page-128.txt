ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! In this activity, students will perform a project check-in, where
they will update fellow team members about their design
progress so far and outline a plan for an upcoming design
sprint based on feedback received. Optionally, give students
or groups a Project Check-In handout to guide them during
this activity.
! Divide the group into project teams. Optionally, redistribute to
students their completed Project Planning, Project Feedback,
and Unfocus Group handouts.
! Give teams time to reflect back on original project goals and
acquired feedback. Invite students to outline next steps and
plans for project refinement for an upcoming design sprint.

By completing this activity, students will:
+  review project progress and feedback
+  develop an outline of activities or tasks required to
complete the project
+  generate a list of resources required to complete the
project

RESOURCES
! Project Check-In handout
