PASS IT ON
WHAT CAN WE CREATE BY BUILDING ON
OTHERS’ WORK?
In this project, you will start developing an
animated story project, and then you will
pass the story on to others to remix, extend,
or reimagine!

START HERE
! Work on a story project that focuses on characters,
scene, plot, or whatever element excites you.
! After 10 minutes, save and share your project
online.
! Rotate & extend another story project by remixing it.
! Repeat!

THINGS TO TRY
! Brainstorm different possibilities for remixing,
extending, or reimagining a story. Do you want
to add a new scene to the end? Could you
imagine what happens before the story begins?
What if a new character was added? How about
inserting a plot twist? What else?

BLOCKS TO PLAY WITH

! Adding comments in your code can help others understand different
parts of your program. To attach a comment to a script, right click on a
block and add a description.
