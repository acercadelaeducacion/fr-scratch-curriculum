ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, demonstrate how to create a new studio or have
the My Studio handout available to guide students.
! Optionally, show example inspiration studios using the links
provided. Give students 10 minutes to browse existing
Scratch projects on the Scratch homepage and search for
interesting programs using the Explore page.
! Ask students to identify three or more Scratch projects that
can be used to inform and inspire a project of their own.
Help students create a new studio from their My Stuff page
and add the inspirational projects to the studio.
! Invite students to share their approaches for finding
inspirational programs. We suggest pair-share: have
students share studios and discuss search strategies in pairs.
! Ask students to think back on the process of discovery by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

OBJECTIVES

By completing this activity, students will:
+  investigate the range of creative possibilities with
Scratch by exploring some of the millions of projects
on the Scratch website
+  curate a collection of 3 or more Scratch projects in a
Scratch studio

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  What search strategies did you use to find interesting
projects?
+  How might each example project help with future work?
+  It’s important to give credit to sources of inspiration. How
can you give credit for inspiration from these projects?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Are there three or more projects in the studio?
+  What do these projects tell you about your students’
design interests?

NOTES
+  If students don’t have individual Scratch accounts, create a
class studio that students can curate.
+  A variety of studios can be created - students could collect
Scratch projects that are similar in theme or topic to what
they want to create or gather programs that include
techniques or assets to incorporate in a future creation.
