UNIT 6
OVERVIEW
THE “BIG IDEA”
In this final unit, students will build on their creative computing
experiences by engaging in the design of an open-ended project
of their choosing. To help you and your students tackle this
open-ended design experience, we were inspired to frame this
unit as a hackathon. With its ethos of embracing just-in-time
learning and problem solving, encouraging iterative planningmaking-sharing, and celebrating a connected and collaborative
environment, the hackathon is an ideal creative computing
culminating experience.
