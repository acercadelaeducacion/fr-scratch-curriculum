UNIT 4 ACTIVITY

OBJECTIVES

T I M E

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, explore the Fish Chomp starter project as a
group and have the Score handout available to guide
students.
! Help students open the Fish Chomp starter project. Give
students time to explore variables by remixing the Fish
Chomp Starter Project to add score to the game. Optionally,
give students time to incorporate score into their previously
started maze, pong, or scrolling game projects.
! Allow students to share their Fish Chomp remixes or game
projects with added score. We suggest the Design Demo
activity: invite a few students to present their projects to the
group and demonstrate how they implemented score using
variables. Optionally, have students add their remixes to the
Fish Chomp Remix studio or a class studio.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  Encourage students to clarify their understanding of
variables by exploring code from sample projects in the
Score examples studio.
+  Variables are an important mathematical and
computational concept. Students are taught about variables
in their math and science classes, but many students have a
difficult time learning them. Games are one way to make
the usefulness of variables more concrete.

By completing this activity, students will:
+  be able to describe what a variable is and why
variables are useful
+  be introduced to the computational concept of data
+  experience remixing and reusing a project or part of a
project

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  How would you explain variables to someone else?
+  What are variables good for?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Can students explain what a variable is and what
variables are good for?
