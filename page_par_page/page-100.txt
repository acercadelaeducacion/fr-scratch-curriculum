OBJECTIVES

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Use the Advanced Concepts, Video Sensing examples, and
Cloning examples studios to show examples and help students
get familiar with blocks that control video sensing and cloning.
Optionally, have the Advanced Concepts handout available to
guide students.
! Give students time to explore the code of example programs to
create a project that experiments with one or more of the
advanced concepts (video sensing, cloning).
! Encourage students to share their explorations with others. We
suggest hosting design demo presentations. Optionally, have
students add their projects to the Advanced Concepts studio
or a class studio.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

By completing this activity, students will:
+  gain more fluency with computational concepts
(events, parallelism, data) and practices
(experimenting and iterating, testing and debugging,
reusing and remixing, abstracting and modularizing)
by creating a project exploring video sensing or
cloning

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  Which advanced concept(s) did you choose to explore?
+  What was your strategy for learning more about the
concept(s) you selected?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Do projects explore one or more of the advanced
concept(s)?

NOTES
+  Students who want to explore the video sensing feature will
require a computer with a webcam.
+  Remind students that the backpack tool can be used to
borrow and remix code from example projects.
