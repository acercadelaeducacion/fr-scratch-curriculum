UNIT 5 ACTIVITY

HARDWARE &
EXTENSIONS
S U G G E S T E D

OBJECTIVES

T I M E

By completing this activity, students will:
+  be introduced to various hardware extensions that
connect the digital world of Scratch with the physical
world

45–60 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! (IMPORTANT: This activity requires access to one or more of
these hardware products.) Introduce students to ways Scratch
can connect to other technologies and hardware extensions
including the LEGO WeDo, MaKey MaKey, and PicoBoard.
Optionally, show examples from the How can I connect Scratch
with other technologies? video playlist.
! Divide students into small groups of 2-4 people. Give the
groups time to explore creating a Scratch project that
incorporates a physical world component using one or more
available hardware extensions.
! Allow each group to share their creations with others. We
suggest facilitating a gallery walk or feedback fair.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  Which hardware or extension did you explore?
+  How did you incorporate the digital and the physical?
+  What was difficult?
+  What was surprising?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Does the work have a digital and a physical component?

NOTES
+  Make this a group-wide activity! Using the LEGO WeDo and
Scratch, challenge students to connect their projects to
create a chain of reactions in the style of a Rube Goldberg
machine. See this video for an example:

+  Activate the Scratch blocks that control hardware extensions
by clicking on the Add an Extension button located under
the More Blocks category in the Scratch project editor.
