5 – 15 M I N U T E S

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Ask students about their experiences with computers using the
reflection prompts to the right.
! Introduce students to creative computing with Scratch and the
range of projects they will be able to create by showing the
Scratch overview video and some sample projects that your
students will find engaging and inspiring. Explain that over the
next several sessions they will be creating their own interactive
computational media with Scratch.
! What will you create? Ask students to imagine what types of
projects they want to create with Scratch.

By completing this activity, students will:
+  be introduced to computational creation with the
Scratch programming environment by watching the
Scratch overview video or exploring sample projects
+  be able to imagine possibilities for their own Scratchbased computational creation

RESOURCES

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  What are the different ways you interact with computers?
+  How many of those ways involve being creative with
computers?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Did students brainstorm a diverse range of project ideas?
If not, try showing a wide variety of projects to give
students a sense of the possibilities.

NOTES
+  If you don’t have internet access, download the Scratch
overview video from Vimeo before class, available at
http://vimeo.com/65583694
+  Instead of writing out their answers to the reflections
prompts, encourage students to get creative by drawing
their responses. (e.g., “Draw different ways you interact
with computers.”)
