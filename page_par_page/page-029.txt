CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
This unit includes a mix of structured and open-ended activities
that engage students in exploration of the key concept of
sequence – identifying and specifying an ordered series of
instructions. This is often a powerful moment for students:
they’re telling the computer what to do, by translating their
ideas into blocks of computer code.
From a step-by-step tutorial, to playing with a constrained
number of blocks, to a debugging challenge, each activity helps
learners build the skills needed to create an About Me project.
In the culminating project, learners will explore and experiment
with sprites, costumes, looks, backdrops, and sounds to create a
personalized, interactive collage in Scratch.
Take advantage of all the activities or pick a few that cater to
your students’ specific needs and interests; the choice is up to
you. If you’re not sure where to start, a possible order for the
activities is suggested below.
