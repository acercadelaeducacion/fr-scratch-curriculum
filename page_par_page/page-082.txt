PONG
HOW CAN YOU USE SCRATCH TO BUILD
AN INTERACTIVE GAME?
In this project, you will create a game. This
game includes interactions between sprites,
score, and levels. The game is similar to the
classic game of pong, where the goal is to
keep the sprite from getting past you.

START HERE
! Create two sprites: a paddle for the user to control
and a ball the user will be playing with.
! Make your paddle sprite interactive.
! Bring your game to life!

THINGS TO TRY
! How do you add difficulty to your game?
Creating different levels, using a timer, or
keeping score are a few examples of things you
could do.
! Experiment with changing the look of your game
by editing the backdrops!
! Explore using different key presses to control
your sprites!

BLOCKS TO PLAY WITH

Interacts with the walls
Interacts with the paddle	  
These control the ball - if touching the paddle or a wall, it continues moving. If
touching red (meaning the ball moved past the paddle) the game ends.
