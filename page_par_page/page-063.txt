CHARACTERS
DO YOU WANT TO CREATE YOUR OWN
SCRATCH BLOCKS?
Experiment with the Make a Block feature in
Scratch! In this project, you will create your own
blocks that define two behaviors for two different
characters.

START HERE
! Choose from the library, paint, or upload two sprite
characters.
! Click on the Make a Block button in the More Blocks
category to create and name your block.
! Add blocks under the Define block to control
what your custom block will do.
! Experiment with using your block to program
your characters’ behaviors.
! Repeat!

THINGS TO TRY
! Feeling stuck? That’s okay! Check out this video to get started with
the Make a Block feature: http://bit.ly/makeablock
! Explore other projects in the Characters Studio to see what new
blocks others have created.
! Sometimes there can be more than one way of defining the same
behavior. Experiment with different block combinations to try out
multiple options and outcomes.
