UNIT 2
OVERVIEW
THE “BIG IDEA”
Kids have shared more than six million projects in the
Scratch online community – animations, stories, games, and
beyond – and one of our goals with the guide is to reflect
this enormous diversity of creations. Within activities, we
support opportunities to personalize and avoid presenting
challenges that have only one “right” answer; across
activities, we engage learners in a variety of genres. In this
unit, we start to explore this creative diversity with a deep
dive into animation, art, and music.
Creative diversity in Scratch has often been highlighted by
learners. Here are a few quotes from learners who were
asked, “If you had to explain what Scratch is to one of your
friends, how would you describe it?”
