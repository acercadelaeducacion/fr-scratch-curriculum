WHAT IS CREATIVE COMPUTING?

Creative computing is about
creativity. Computer science and
computing-related fields have long been
introduced to young people in a way that is
disconnected from their interests and
values – emphasizing technical detail over
creative potential. Creative computing
supports the development of personal
connections to computing, by drawing upon
creativity, imagination, and interests.

Creative computing is about
empowerment. Many young people
with access to computers participate as
consumers, rather than designers or
creators. Creative computing emphasizes
the knowledge, practices, and fundamental
literacies that young people need to create
the types of dynamic and interactive
computational media that they enjoy in
their daily lives.

Creative computing is about
computing. Engaging in the creation
of computational artifacts prepares young
people for more than careers as computer
scientists or programmers. It supports
young people’s development as
computational thinkers – individuals who
can draw on computational concepts,
practices, and perspectives in all aspects of
their lives, across disciplines and contexts.
