UNIT 1 ACTIVITY

PROGRAMMED TO
DANCE
S U G G E S T E D

By completing this activity, students will:
+  learn to express a complex activity using a sequence of
simple instructions

T I M E

45–60 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Ask for 8 volunteers – four people who don’t mind being bossy
and four people who don’t mind being bossed. Create four
bossy/bossed pairs. Optionally, have a projector ready to
present the Programmed to Dance videos.
! For each bossy/bossed pair:
1. Have the bossed partner facing away from the display
and the bossy partner (and the rest of the group) facing the
display.
2. Show the video to the bossy partner and the group, but
NOT to the bossed partner.
3. Ask the bossy partner to describe to their partner (using
only words!) how to perform the sequence of dance moves
shown in the video.
! Use this activity to start a discussion about the importance
of sequence in specifying a set of instructions. You can let
students reflect individually in their design journals or
facilitate a group discussion by inviting different bossy/
bossed pairs and observers to share their thoughts.

NOTES
+  This is one of several activities in this guide that are
computer-free. Stepping back from the computer can
support fresh perspectives on and new understandings of
computational concepts, practices, and perspectives.
+  Have students write down step-by-step instructions for one
of the dances. In programming, this is called “pseudocode”.
