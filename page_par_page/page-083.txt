SCROLLING
HOW CAN YOU USE SCRATCH TO BUILD
AN INTERACTIVE GAME?
In this project, you will create a game. This
game includes interactions between sprites,
score, and levels. The game is similar to
Flappy Bird, where the goal is to keep an
object from falling to the ground or touching
certain objects.

START HERE
Controls sprite movement

! Create two sprites: one for the player to control
(helicopter) and one to avoid (gliding bars).
! Make the helicopter interactive.
! Bring your game to life by adding scripts to make
the gliding bars scroll across the stage!

THINGS TO TRY
! How do you add difficulty to your game?
Creating different levels, using a timer, or
keeping score are a few examples of things you
could do.
! Experiment with changing the look of your game
by editing the backdrops!
! Explore using different key presses to control
your sprites!

This creates clones, which are used in the script
below to make the bars scroll across the screen:

BLOCKS TO PLAY WITH
