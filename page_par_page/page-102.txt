VIDEO SENSING
HOW CAN YOU USE VIDEO SENSING IN
YOUR SCRATCH PROJECTS?
Did you know that you can make your
Scratch projects interactive through a
webcam? Explore this advanced Scratch
concept by creating a project that
incorporates the video sensing feature.

START HERE
! Open an existing Scratch project or start a new
project to add video sensing.
! Check out blocks for video sensing in the Sensing
category.
! Experiment with video on, turn video, and set video
transparency to blocks to program your project to
sense video motion.

THINGS TO TRY

FINISHED?

! Make sure your webcam is connected! Test it out using the turn video on
block.
! If you’re feeling a little stuck, that’s okay! Explore some of the other
projects in the Video Sensing studio to see how they use the video blocks or
use the Tips Window to learn more about video sensing.
