DEBUG IT!
HELP! CAN YOU DEBUG THESE FIVE
SCRATCH PROGRAMS?
In this activity, you will investigate what is
going awry and find a solution for each of
the five Debug It! challenges.

! DEBUG IT! 2.1 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23266426
In this project, Scratch Cat wants to show you a dance. When you
click on him, he should do a dance while a drum beat plays along
with him. However, as soon as he starts to dance he stops but the
drumming continues without him! How do we fix this program?

! DEBUG IT! 2.2 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24268476
In this project, when the green flag is clicked Pico should move
towards Nano. When Pico reaches Nano, Pico should say “Tag, you’re
it!” and Nano says “My turn!” But something is wrong! Pico doesn’t
say anything to Nano. How do we fix the program?

! DEBUG IT! 2.3 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/24268506

START HERE
! Go to the Unit 2 Debug It! Studio:
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475539
! Test and debug each of the five debugging
challenges in the studio.
! Write down your solution or remix the buggy
program with your solution.

This project is programmed to draw a happy face but something is
not quite right! The pen continues to draw from one of the eyes to
the smile when it should not be doing so. How do we fix the
program?

! DEBUG IT! 2.4 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23267140
In this project, when the green flag is clicked an animation of a
flower growing begins and stops once it has fully bloomed. But
something is not quite right! Instead of stopping when all the petals
have bloomed, the animation starts all over. How do we fix this
program?

! DEBUG IT! 2.5 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23267245

THINGS…

! Make a list of possible bugs in the program.
! Keep track of your work! This can be a useful reminder of
what you have already tried and point you toward what to
try next.
! Share and compare your problem finding and problem
solving approaches with a neighbor until you find
something that works for you!

In this project, the Happy Birthday song starts playing when the
green flag is clicked. Once the song finishes, instructions should
appear telling us to "click on me to blow out the candles!" But
something is not working! The instructions to blow out the candles
are shown while the birthday song is playing rather than after it
finishes. How do we fix this program?

FINISHED?
+  Add code commentary by right clicking on blocks in your scripts.
This can help others understand different parts of your program!
+  Discuss your testing and debugging practices with a partner –
make notes of the similarities and differences in your strategies.
+  Help a neighbor!
