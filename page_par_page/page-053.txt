IT’S ALIVE!
HOW CAN YOU TAKE AN IMAGE OR A
PHOTO AND MAKE IT COME ALIVE?
In this activity, you will explore ways of
bringing sprites, images, and ideas to life as
an animation by programming a series of
costume changes.

START HERE
! Choose a sprite.
! Add a different costume.
! Add blocks to make the image come alive.
! Repeat!

THINGS TO TRY
! Try sketching your animation ideas on
paper first – like a flipbook.
! Experiment with different blocks and
costumes until you find something you
enjoy.
! Need some inspiration? Find projects in the
Animation section of the Explore page.

FINISHED?

+  Challenge yourself to do more! Add more features to your project to make your
animations look even more lifelike.
+  Help a neighbor!
+  Share your project with a partner and walk them through your design process.
+  Find an animated project you’re inspired by and remix it!
