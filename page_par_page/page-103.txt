CLONING
HOW CAN YOU USE CLONING IN YOUR
SCRATCH PROJECTS?
Cloning is an easy way to create multiples of
the same sprite. You can use cloning to make
many objects and create cool effects in a
project.
Explore this advanced Scratch concept by
creating a project that incorporates the
cloning feature.

START HERE
! Open an existing Scratch project or start a new
project to experiment with cloning.
! Check out blocks for cloning in the Control category.
! Experiment with the blocks to create clones of your
sprite. Define behaviors for what your cloned sprites
will do.

THINGS TO TRY
! If you can’t see your clone initially, check if the original sprite is in the
same location – it might be covering the clone! Program your original
sprite or the clone to move or go to different locations so you can see them.
! Stuck? That’s okay! Explore some of the other projects in the Cloning
Studio to see how they use cloning or search in the Tips Window to learn
more about the Create Clone and When I start as a Clone blocks.

FINISHED?
+  Add your project to the Cloning studio:
http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/201437
+  Add cloning to one of your past projects!
+  Help a neighbor!
+  Remix a project in the Cloning studio.
