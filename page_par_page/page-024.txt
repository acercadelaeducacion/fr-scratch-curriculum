ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Introduce students to the idea of a critique group, a small
group of designers who share ideas and projects-in-progress
with one another in order to get feedback and suggestions for
further development.
! Optionally, have the Critique Group handout available to guide
students in giving feedback.
! Divide students in smaller groups of 3-4 people. In these
critique groups, ask students to take turns sharing their
ideas, drafts, or prototypes, for example, Scratch Surprise
projects.
! Let students gather feedback by having their critique group
members respond to the Red, Yellow, Green reflection
prompts or using the Critique Group handout. Encourage
students to record other notes, feedback, and suggestions in
their design journals.

NOTES
+  It can be valuable to have a dedicated group of peers to
give you encouragement and feedback on your design
iterations. Provide opportunities for students to continue
meeting with their critique groups during Units 1-6.
