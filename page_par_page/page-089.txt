THINGS…

! Before getting started in Scratch, write down ideas in your
design journal for possible ways of programming each of
the interactivity puzzles.
! Work with a neighbor. Collaborating with a partner can be
a great way to solve problems and gain new perspectives
on ways of programming in Scratch!

! PUZZLE 9: Whenever you move the mouse-pointer, the sprite
follows but doesn't touch the mouse-pointer.
