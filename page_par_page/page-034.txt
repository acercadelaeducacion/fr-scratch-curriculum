ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Help students sign in to their Scratch accounts and click on
the Create button at the top of the Scratch website to start a
new project. Optionally, have the 10 Blocks handout available
to guide students during the activity.
! Give students time to create a project with only these 10
Scratch blocks: go to, glide, say, show, hide, set size to, play
sound until done, when this sprite clicked, wait, and repeat.
Remind students to use each block at least once in their
project and encourage them to experiment with different
sprites, costumes, or backdrops.
! Invite students to share their projects in their critique groups
(see the Unit 0 Critique Group activity). Optionally, have
students add their projects to the 10 Blocks studio or a class
studio.
! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  It’s surprising how much one can do with just 10 blocks!
Take this opportunity to encourage different ideas and
celebrate creativity by inviting a few students to present
their projects in front of the class or by exploring other
projects online in the 10 Blocks studio.
