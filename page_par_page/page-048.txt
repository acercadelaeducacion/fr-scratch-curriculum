UNIT 2 ACTIVITY

BUILD-A-BAND
S U G G E S T E D

T I M E

30–45 MINUTES

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
! Optionally, show example projects from the Build-a-Band
studio and have the Build-a-Band handout available to guide
students.
! Give students time to create interactive instruments by
pairing sprites with sounds. Encourage them to experiment
with different ways to express sounds in Scratch by
exploring other blocks in the Sounds category or using the
editing tools within the Sounds tab.
! Allow students to demonstrate their bands to one another
or let students walk around to interact with classmates’
instruments. We recommend a gallery walk: have students
put their projects in presentation mode and then invite
them to walk around and explore each other’s projects.
Optionally, have students add their projects to the Build-aBand studio or a class studio.

OBJECTIVES

By completing this activity, students will:
+  create a program that combines interactive sprites with
interesting sounds
+  develop greater fluency with sequence, loops, events,
and parallelism
+  practice experimenting and iterating in building up
project creations

REFLECTION PROMPTS
+  What did you do first?
+  What did you do next?
+  What did you do last?

REVIEWING STUDENT WORK
+  Do projects make creative use of sounds?
+  Are the sprites in the projects interactive?

! Ask students to think back on the design process by
responding to the reflection prompts in their design
journals or in a group discussion.

NOTES
+  To share as a whole group, have students perform their
Scratch instruments together to form a class band!
