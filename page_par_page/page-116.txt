POSSIBLE PATH
The hackathon-inspired activities for this unit are designed to challenge students to build up a more complex project within an open-ended
and collaborative learning environment. All of the important culture-building we’ve been doing – encouraging risk-taking and persistence,
recognizing failures as learning opportunities, focusing on process over product, and cultivating a culture of cooperation and fun –
culminates in this unit.
To help you get started, we have included a suggested sequence of activities that follow the plan-make-share design cycle.
