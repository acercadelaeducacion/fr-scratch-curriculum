CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
Rather than focusing on a particular theme or genre like the three
previous units, this unit is intended to create a space for reviewing
and reflecting on prior work. This unit’s activities are especially
flexible, diving deeper into creative computing by revisiting
challenges, extending skills, or refining practices.
Begin by inviting students to review their past work and engage in
self-assessment of their learning goals in the Know Want Learn
activity.
Then, encourage students to dive deeper into Scratch by choosing
which follow-up activities to pursue.
